# Project name: css-animations

## Project mission
In this exercise, you will build a complex animation, step by step.
As often with CSS, this is an exercise in precision and accuracy (and a zest of dementia, because... CSS). To give you a reliable visual assistant, you will thus use a technique that could be called "the image background guide Technique".
